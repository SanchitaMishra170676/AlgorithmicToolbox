# Algorithmic Toolbox
### Contains solution of assignment of Algorithmic Toolbox course offered by university of California on coursera

# Week 1 :Programming Challenges
### General programming Question for revision

# Week 2 : Algorithmic warmup
## Making programs more effective by avoiding the use of reccursion in programs like calculation of fibonnaci series 
### Using techniques like Memoisation

# Week 3: Greedy Algorithms 
## Strategy:
Greedy algorithms work in stages, a a decision is made that is good at that point, without bothering about the future. This means that some local best is chosen.
### It assumes that a local good selection makes for a global optimal solution.

## Elements:
* Greedy Choice property
* Optimal substructure 
### Greedy Choice Property 
This property says that globally optimal solution can be obtained by making a locally optimal solution (Greed). The choice made by a greedy algorithm mah depend on either choices but not onn the future. It itteratively makes one greedy choice after another and reduces the given problem into a smaller one.
### Optimal Substructure
A problem exhibits optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solution to the subproblems. That means we can solve subproblems and buildup the solution to solve larger problems.

#### Greedy algorithms does not always work

## Advantage 
Main advantage is that it is straight formward, easy tp understand and easy to code. Once we make a decison we donot have to spend time re-examining the already computed values.

## Disadvantage
For many problems there is no greedy solution.
